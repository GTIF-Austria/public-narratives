## Product Description

As the demand for renewable energy continues to grow, efficient and accurate mapping of solar installations becomes increasingly essential. N Vision's advanced geographical survey solution offers a game-changing approach to solar energy planning. Using AI-based computer vision algorithms and high-resolution aerial or satellite imagery, the service delivers precise, actionable data. This technology empowers downstream planning institutions to optimize the deployment and management of solar energy systems, helping drive the transition to a more sustainable and energy-efficient future.

By harnessing cutting-edge AI and imaging technologies, the service accurately maps the locations and configurations of solar panels and derive relevant KPIs to provide vital information that enhances decision-making and performance optimization. Whether users are planning for urban areas or vast rural landscapes, N Vision's solution offers unparalleled accuracy and scalability.

### Accuracy

For mapped solar panels, the service aims to achieve at least 95% or higher in both precision and recall. The efficient data validation workflow ensures high quality data output on which users can trust. 

### Add-Ons

Optionally, the service can provide additional analysis by classifying panels into photovoltaic and solar heat, or if depth data is available,  the angle and orientation of solar installations can be derived.

### Deliverables

As a result, users will receive the full set of mapped solar panels and belonging attributes. Further,the service provides a report with insightful KPIs of the extracted data. Custom KPIs can be added to support individual user planning and decision making initiatives.

### Data Access

Users will receive the extracted data in standard GIS files and, additionally, they will be able to fetch the data from N Vision's API to automatically integrate the results into the user's workflows. 
* API Interface: Common GIS API protocols like WFS, MVT and WMS.
* GIS File Formats: e.g. Geopackage or GeoJSON. 

### Disclaimer

Due to the nature of using ortho imagery, only solar panels which are visible in the images can be extracted, e.g. solar panels mounted on vertical facades or occluded panels cannot be mapped. The accuracy of mapped solar panels depends on the quality of the imagery. Usually, the higher the quality (and resolution) of the images, the higher the accuracy of the extracted data. During manual validation, no onside validation is performed. Validation is performed using ortho-imagery only. 

### Pricing

N Vision's goal is to provide customers with a fair offer which is tailored to the specific needs. Please contact sales to get a customized quote matching the requirements.

### Ortho Imagery

In case there is no ortho imagery available for the user's area of interest, N Vision can provide support in researching existing open datasets or, if needed, in procurement of data captures.

### Test Data

In order to support customer's buying decision, N Vision provides free demos of its solutions and sample data. Additionally, [here](https://www.n-vision.ai/map/?project=gleisdorf_uce41_20221003_solar_panels&lon=15.70516119420537&lat=47.10721627715415&viewer=&zoom=18.76685750568019)  a small interactive demo for mapped solar panels is provided.
