## Product Description

As the demand for renewable energy continues to grow, efficient and accurate mapping of solar installations becomes increasingly essential. Our advanced geographical survey solution offers a game-changing approach to solar energy planning. Using our AI-based computer vision algorithms and high-resolution aerial or satellite imagery, we are able to deliver precise, actionable data. This technology empowers downstream planning institutions to optimize the deployment and management of solar energy systems, helping drive the transition to a more sustainable and energy-efficient future.

By harnessing cutting-edge AI and imaging technologies, we accurately map the locations and configurations of solar panels and derive relevant KPIs to provide vital information that enhances decision-making and performance optimization. Whether you are planning for urban areas or vast rural landscapes, our solution offers unparalleled accuracy and scalability.

### Accuracy

For mapped solar panels, we aim to achieve at least 95% or higher in both precision and recall. Our efficient data validation workflow ensures that you receive high quality data you can trust. 

### Add-Ons

Optionally, we can provide additional analysis by classifying panels into photovoltaic and solar heat, or if depth data is available, we can derive the angle and orientation of solar installations.

### Deliverables

As a result, you will receive the full set of mapped solar panels and belonging attributes. Further, we provide a report with insightful KPIs of the extracted data. We are happy to add custom KPIs to support your planning and decision making initiatives, just let us know your specific needs.

### Data Access

You will receive the extracted data in standard GIS files and, additionally, you will be able to fetch the data from our API to automatically integrate the results into your workflows. 
* API Interface: Common GIS API protocols like WFS, MVT and WMS.
* GIS File Formats: e.g. Geopackage or GeoJSON. 

### Disclaimer

Due to the nature of using ortho imagery, only solar panels which are visible in the images can be extracted, e.g. solar panels mounted on vertical facades or occluded panels cannot be mapped. The accuracy of mapped solar panels depends on the quality of the imagery. Usually, the higher the quality (and resolution) of the images, the higher the accuracy of the extracted data. During manual validation, no onside validation is performed. Validation is performed using ortho imagery only. 

### Pricing

Our goal is to provide you with a fair offer which is tailored to your specific needs. Please contact sales to get a customized quote matching your requirements.

### Ortho Imagery

In case there is no ortho imagery available for your area of interest, please contact us. We support you in researching existing open datasets or, if needed, in procurement of data captures.

### Test Data

In order to support your buying decision, we provide free demos of our solutions and sample data. Additionally, [here](https://www.n-vision.ai/map/?project=gleisdorf_uce41_20221003_solar_panels&lon=15.70516119420537&lat=47.10721627715415&viewer=&zoom=18.76685750568019)  we provide a small interactive demo for mapped solar panels. 

Do you have specific needs or problems which are not covered here? Letâ€™s get in touch, we are very flexible with respect to custom solutions tailored to your needs. 

We are looking forward to hearing from you.
