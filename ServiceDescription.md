# Heat Risk Maps
Subtitle
## Problem & Needs
## List <!--{ as="div" }-->
- Heat extremes at daytime and no cooling at nighttime: climate change poses a rising threat to urban life. Austria’s cities experienced almost a tripling of heat days and tropical nights – with the trend still increasing.
- Exposure to heat causes significant stress on humans – especially for vulnerable groups, like children or elderly, the health consequences of prolonged exposure are serious.
- High population densities and the urban heat island effect force cities to adapt and take action to tackle the rising threat. But adaptation measures are often only locally effective, and funds are limited.
- The pressing question is: where to act? Where are heat-reducing measures the most effective to protect vulnerable groups? 
- … and where to start? Which adaption measures should be prioritized due to the risk at hand?
- Not only is this an acute concern for cities and municipalities, but also for companies and organizations required to assess future heat risks.
- This highlights the need for heat risk maps, which take vulnerable groups into account and effectively locate high risk areas.



## Solution Capability
Risk – based on the IPCC definition – is a combination of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. Well-founded risk assessment is the first step to locate measures where needed, shape future developments, and direct impactful investments. Various data from different disciplines need to be comprehensively compiled and connected. But how to combine the available information in a meaningful way and create scientifically sound heat risk maps? 
The developed heat-risk-algorithm merges state-of-the-art satellite information, like building structure, degree of soil sealing or tree cover, with population statistics, as well as high-resolution climate data tailored to Austria. The blend of open-source data with important area-specific datasets does not only allow to create customized heat risk maps for a selected city or municipality, but also ensures high quality and reliable results. The methodology allows the heat risk maps to be calculated regularly when new or updated datasets are available, making the effects of adaptation measures and urban development visible. It also offers the possibility to incorporate future spatial planning scenarios or demographic developments and helps to anticipate future impacts. The aim of the heat risk map is to present the information visually and in an easy-to-understand manner making the maps universally applicable for a wide range of use-cases.

## Use-case examples
## Use-case examples <!--{ as="div" }-->

-	Heat action and heat protection plans: Integration of heat risk maps can support to tailor actions to the areas at risk.
-	Urban development concepts: Heat Risk Maps provide valuable information to spatial development and city planners in making their city liveable for the future.
-	Prioritization of adaptation measures: The heat risk concept allows to compare areas within cities and quantify adaptation measures customized to high-risk places.
-	Update current heat risk information: Changing climate conditions, development of urban areas and changed population statistics make outdated maps unusable. The developed algorithm allows updates on the fly.
-	Finding locations with future risks: Organizations and companies dealing with vulnerable groups, can identify locations with high or low current and future heat risk, which is crucial for planning operation centres and deployments.
