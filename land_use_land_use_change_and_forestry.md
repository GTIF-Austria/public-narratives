# GHG-KIT LULUCF Activity Data

## LULUCY yearly status maps 2015-2023 over Austria

The Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) status maps and statistics are yearly representations of land use categories produced with the GHG-KIT LULUCF Inventory reporter using Copernicus time-series satellite data. The data support authorities in their National Inventory Reports (NIR) for reporting of anthropogenic Greenhouse Gas emissions and removals, building on the methodology developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The LULUCF maps were produced by GeoVille Information Systems and Data Processing GmbH by means of a deep learning U-Net automated supervised classification algorithm and quality assessed by visual interpretation, with an Overall Accuracy of 97%.
