# WR07 - Exploring the Earth's Gentle Warmth: A Tool for Harnessing Shallow Geothermal Energy

Imagine a clean, renewable energy source right beneath our feet, quietly waiting to heat our homes and communities. Shallow geothermal energy taps into the Earth's gentle warmth, just a few meters below the surface, offering a sustainable solution for heating and cooling. Our project brings this incredible resource closer to everyone with an easy-to-use online tool that calculates its potential and efficiency.
Powered by cutting-edge remote sensing technology, the tool analyses data from Sentinel-1 satellites, ERA5-land, Sentinel-3 that monitor the Earth's surface with remarkable precision. Using this data, we provide insights into the availability and performance of shallow geothermal energy in specific locations. While initially developed and tested in Austria, the tool's global applicability means it can help individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide explore this eco-friendly energy option.
Based on the approach used to produce the ThermoMap (1a), using the Rosetta model (1b), the E-Bod Bodenkarte Austria (1c) and the Harmonized World Soil Database (1d) we want to evaluate the thermal conductivity.
