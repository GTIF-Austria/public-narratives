# Transport Infrastructure Predictive Maintenance

#### Deformation monitoring of infrastructure assets via satellite radar data <!--{ style="font-size:1rem;opacity:0.7;margin-top:1rem;" }-->

## Problem & Needs

Infrastructure assets like roads and bridges are the enablers of the mobility transition. These vital components of the road infrastructure are however subject to various hazards. Some of these, such as excessive settlements, scouring or structural deterioration, are often accompanied by early deformations, which may indicate beforehand an approaching damage or even collapse. Thus, monitoring the displacements at the locations of crucial civil infrastructure could provide an early warning system for these assets. Furthermore, a timely detection of irregular behavior of bridges or road sections can greatly improve the level of information available to the operators of infrastructure networks. If such data would be made available to railway and highway authorities or city administrations, they could develop their maintenance strategies considering these valuable insights. As a consequence they would be enabled to forecast upcoming maintenance works more accurately and would also be able to prioritize better, thus focusing their resources more effectively.         

## Solution Capability

The Deformation Monitoring of Critical Infrastructure (DMCI) Capability will be a service, which provides the infrastructure operators with this valuable additional data. Within the framework of the ESA - Green Transition Information Factories project the potentials of this capability will be demonstrated on a corridor of approximately 20-30 km length at one of the main Austrian road arteries, however it can be rolled out to the entire road or railway network of a city, region our country later on.  

### DMCI Map

The customer will be able to visualize the deformations over time of the infrastructure assets in her/his care in an interactive map. In this map any linear object of interest, such as a road, railway or bridge will be represented by a series of points along the axis of the infrastructure asset. For each of these points the measured ground movements will be displayed, based on pre-processed Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) data from Sentinel-1 satellites provided by the European Ground Motion Service [(EGMS)](https://land.copernicus.eu/en/products/european-ground-motion-service).
The points are color-coded, with green points showing no significant deformations, red points showing subsidence and blue points highlighting uplifts. Points may be missing if no reliable data is available due to insignificant number of reflection points for the radar signal or unacceptably high scatter in the readings.

## About
### Provider Entities

The following entities are, or may be, involved in the provision of the DMCI Capability:

[Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT)](https://www.ait.ac.at/en/research-topics/structural-dynamics-and-assessment)

The Austrian Institute is the provider of the capability by developing and applying the routines required to combine InSAR data provided by EGMS with the geographic coordinates of the infrastructure components and evaluating it to deliver data which can be interpreted by the experts of the infrastructre operators.

## Subscriptions
### Pricing

For infrastructure operators such as ASFiNAG, Ã–BB or the regional road authorities the satellite monitoring of the infrastructure in their care would provide an essential remote method to complete their toolbox of inspection techniques, thus greatly enhancing their opportunities for predictive maintenance.

There are several alternative options for these authorities to sign up for this service. Different areas of interest may be defined, starting from individual structures such as bridges, through road or railway sections, up to infrastructure networks in a city, region or even the entire country. Depending on the actual user requirements individual subscription and pricing models can be defined. As the processing of the data is highly automatized, for a small additional fee the area covered can be increased significantly.

The third dimension of interest is the temporal resolution required. Since the deformation monitoring of infrastructure assets mainly aims on detecting slow, long-time changes and the EGMS data is provided yearly an annual update of the maps would be recommended. More frequent updates are however possible if requested by the client, this however requires individual data processing and should be considered a premium service with significantly higher costs.

Finally, the spacial resolution of the monitoring may also be increased by relying on high resolution radar data such as provided by TerraSAR-X (instead of Sentinel-1), however this package would be even higher priced, as o top of the individual data processing the InSAR data would have to be acquired first from commercial providers of X-band radar data.
