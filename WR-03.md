# Energy Nowcasting for solar and wind energy

**[TODO: add fancy animation (wind field and clouds)]

## Introduction
A gentle wind, warm rays of sunshine… it does help us feel warm and welcome. And,  it provides renewable and sustainable energy ready to be used enabling the transition to a fossil free future. 
However, the nature of weather, and thus wind and solar irradiation, is chaotic and a steady and stable, non-fluctuating “flow” of produced energy is only possible under calm-weather conditions. 
This is challenging in many ways, for grid operators to ensure a stable power grid for the next hours, for energy traders for intra-day and longer-term perspectives, for wind- and PV-farm operators.

How can we support the energy transition and ensure optimised usage and distribution of the renewable resources based on prevailing atmospheric conditions on the shorter timescales, 
i.e. the nowcasting and intra-day range? The answer is, by providing spatially and temporarily high resolved windspeed at different hub heights , windenergypotential/production for 
selected turbine types, and solar potential predictions. This is done using the latest available numerical weather prediction model data at a set of different hub heights and fed into 
a Nowcasting algorithm. For wind this is a ConvLSTM capable of representing also extreme windspeeds. These predicted wind speeds are converted to  wind power for a set of pre-defined 
reference turbines.

and something for solar]**

For solar this is done using a combination of numerical weather prediction data as input for the solar irradiation model Strahlgrid and subsequently a downscaling with a very 
high-resolution surface model.

**[Add workflow, steps for solar radiation as plots]**

This tool offers the potential of a more scheduled and precise planning of usage and distribution of wind and solar energy for the next hours ahead, supporting small windfarms, homeowners, 
grid operators.  By combining the power of satellite data and advanced calculations, we’re making it easier than ever to tap into the Earth's renewable energy and contribute to a greener future.
