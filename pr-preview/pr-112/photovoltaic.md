# Austrian Photovoltaic Potential

## Background

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The initial situation of the photovoltaic (PV) technology field comprises the refinement of the general storylines, assumptions regarding the development of new buildings up to 2040, and the ecological requirements relevant for eligibility for funding, with particular emphasis on the installation of PV systems on open land.

## Methodology

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Fundamentally, a nationwide, uniform land assessment is conducted across Austria, which is aggregated into three assessment dimensions: building-integrated PV, ground-mounted PV on sealed surfaces, and ground-mounted PV on unsealed surfaces. PV installations along and on linear technical infrastructure are considered part of ground-mounted PV on sealed surfaces.

#### Assessment of Technical Potentials 

**Buildings (Roof and Façade)**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The PV electricity yield potential for roofs and façades across the Austrian territory is derived from GIS datasets. Taking into account averaged system efficiencies, which are assumed to improve slightly over time (from 18.98% in the target year 2030 to 20.4% in the target year 2040), a potential electricity yield in kilowatt-hours of alternating current is calculated for each roof type. As technological innovation and cost reductions in electricity generation are expected within the sector, the long-term potential for 2040 includes an expansion of eligible roof areas to those with global irradiation values of at least 550 kWh/m²·a.

**Open Land**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> For the purposes of the calculations, open land areas are classified into 26 land-use categories. To determine PV potential, potentially suitable open land areas were identified and categorized based on available geospatial data. A general distinction is made between area-based and linear land-use structures. 

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The total land area of Austria is reduced by those areas that cannot be considered suitable for ground-mounted photovoltaic systems. Land-cover classes include contaminated sites, commercial and industrial areas, extraction sites, agricultural land, grassland with and without agricultural use, wasteland, settlement areas, forests including managed forestry, and large public parking areas.

#### Assessment of Realizable Potentials 

**Buildings (Roof and Façade)**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The technically usable roof and façade areas are reduced by economic and social realization factors. Potentials on pitched and flat roofs are assessed with slightly different weighting. The building footprint areas expanded in the target years are distributed analogously to the existing proportions of the two roof types. This results in realizable potentials differentiated by three storylines and two target years.

**Open Land**

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Realizable potentials for the target years 2030 and 2040 are determined on the basis of additional parameters and expert assumptions, applying economic and social realization factors in a two-step procedure. Individual usability factors are assigned to different land-cover classes under the respective considerations. 

## Results

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The following chapter presents the results of the potential assessment for the years 2030 and 2040. For both target years, potentials are aggregated across three spatial levels: national, federal state, and municipal.

#### Presentation of Results

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Figure 1 and Figure 2 summarize the realizable photovoltaic potentials for the target years, as well as the existing installed capacity in 2024 and the technical potential for 2040 for Austria.

### Evaluation of the Results

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The realizable potentials for 2030 (across all ranges) and for 2040 (in the Low and Medium ranges) are broadly comparable in scale to those identified in earlier assessments (Umweltbundesamt, 2023). In the High range, however, the realizable potential for 2040 reaches 53.4 TWh, which is significantly higher than the 47.1 TWh estimated in the aforementioned study.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Over the analysis period, the ratio between building-integrated PV and conventional ground-mounted PV converges, although the majority of deployment in the present model continues to occur on buildings. This outcome reflects both the observed trends of recent years and broader structural developments, including the electrification of building-related applications, the increasing (and economically viable) availability of storage solutions, the requirements of the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive with regard to “solar readiness,” and the high level of acceptance of energy communities.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Higher realization factors were assumed for commercial and industrial sites, as these areas are considered to be well developed, secured, and readily integrable into planning processes. They are also typically associated with sufficient demand and available investment capital, and a high level of social acceptance was assumed. In combination with the substantial availability of such areas, this results in comparatively high PV potentials. Similar considerations apply to other sealed and already developed surfaces; however, due to their more fragmented spatial structure and potentially higher infrastructural, political, and social requirements, their relative contribution to the overall mix remains smaller.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The comparatively small share of realizable potential attributed to other unsealed open land is explained by the high ecological and social value associated with these categories. These include, in addition to managed and unmanaged grassland, protected natural assets, designated habitat corridors, and areas classified under IUCN categories V and VI. In practice, grassland could potentially be utilized more intensively than indicated in this study, as such areas are subject to higher ownership dynamics and may allow for more flexible compensation area management. In these cases, actual realizability will be strongly influenced by the feasibility of grid connection.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> For ground-mounted PV on unsealed land, greater spatial disparities in realizable potentials are observed compared to the other two categories, with the largest potentials located predominantly in eastern Austria. By contrast, the distribution of realizable PV potentials on buildings and sealed/developed open land reflects Austria’s decentralized settlement structure and the nationwide presence of building stock.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Expansion strategies in several federal states prioritize economically efficient and decentralized PV deployment on already sealed surfaces and buildings. The considerations and objectives of these strategies were incorporated into the applied realization factors. Empirical assessments of PV deployment to date indicate a higher degree of spatial concentration than is reflected in the present nationwide modeling approach. These analyses also suggest that the majority of ground-mounted PV installations to date have been realized on unsealed land. At the same time, it becomes evident that substantial portions of the technical potential on other land categories may remain unused. This highlights the considerable scope available for steering and shaping framework conditions through policy measures, with a view to achieving electricity demand coverage and providing adequate balancing capacity within an integrated electricity grid.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Overall, achieving the generation capacities envisaged in the Austrian National Infrastructure Plan (ÖNIP) for the target year 2040 appears feasible. The electricity volumes required for this objective, along with a plausible composition of the necessary spatially distributed surface qualities, are reflected in the Medium storyline.
