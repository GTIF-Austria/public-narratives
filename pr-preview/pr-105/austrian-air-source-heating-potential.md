# Austrian Air Source Heating Potential  

## Background 
The objective of the study is to conduct a nationwide, methodologically consistent assessment of renewable energy potentials in Austria for the years 2030 and 2040, employing the appropriate spatial resolution. Key parameters, including the economic viability from both present and future perspectives, site-specific factors, seasonal availability, the influence of technological advancements, and the impacts of climate change on resource availability and exploitation, are systematically considered.

As a result of the study, optimized technical air heat energy potentials are modelled from a cost perspective, incorporating feasibility considerations. The realizable potentials for 2030 and 2040 are presented through the online ESA Web-GIS tool. These potentials are provided with defined ranges, spanning from Low (conservative and less ambitious) to High (optimistic and ambitious), as well as a Medium view (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence).
Currently, no nationwide harmonized dataset exists concerning the spatial distribution of potential for air heat. However, as part of the project "Spatial Energy Planning for Heat Transition" (FFG project 868850), a methodological foundation was established, though it was not fully developed into an operational model. Building upon these initial efforts, the current project has successfully developed, implemented, and applied a consistent methodological framework that is applicable across Austria for determining potential.

According to the market survey 17/2024, by the end of 2023, a total of 491,361 heat pump systems were in operation in Austria, with 68.2% of these being air-to-water heat pumps. The thermal energy provided by all heat pumps amounted to approximately 9,859 GWh, with 6,610 GWh coming from utilized ambient heat. The proportion of air heat within the total utilized ambient heat is simplified by applying the market share for air heat pumps, with similar approaches used for all other types of heat pump systems.

## Methodological Concept

### Definition and Delimitation
In this study, the potential for air heat is

defined as the utilization of ambient air as an energy source for air-to-water heat pumps, primarily to meet space heating and hot water demands in buildings, as well as for integration into district heating networks. This technology field encompasses not only air-to-water heat pumps but also includes hot water heat pumps, air-to-air heat pumps, and ventilation systems with heat recovery in decentralized applications.

### Theoretical Potential:
The thermal energy stored in ambient air is, under standard conditions, physically unlimited. Due to its theoretical nature of being inexhaustible and its limited relevance for estimating potential, no explicit quantification was conducted in this study.

### Technical Potential:
The technical viability of utilizing air heat is predominantly influenced by the efficiency of the heat pump, which is primarily governed by the following factors:

* Heat Source: The average monthly ambient air temperature at the specific location.
* Heat Sink: The required supply temperature for the heating or hot water system, which is determined by the building's construction period and its renovation status.

To determine the Annual Performance Factor (JAZ), the heat demand, as outlined by the Austrian Heat Map, is partitioned into a constant hot water demand (WWB) and a heating degree-day weighted space heating demand (HWB). This division is based on the distribution of building ages and their respective renovation statuses (see Figure 1).

### Explanation of Performance Calculation:
In the context of air heat pumps employed for combined space heating and hot water production in Austrian single-family homes (EFH), the following practical guidelines are typically applied:

##### Table 1: Full load hours of an air heat pump for combined space heating and hot water production in a typical Austrian single-family home (EFH)

| Building Type / Standard       | Space Heating + Hot Water [kWh/a] | Heat Pump Rated Power [kW] | Full Load Hours [h/a] |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Old Building (unsanated)       | 20,000 – 25,000                    | 10 – 14                     | 1,800 – 2,200           |
| New Building (well insulated)  | 8,000 – 12,000                     | 6 – 8                       | 1,300 – 1,600           |
| Low energy / Passive House     | 4,000 – 6,000                      | 3 – 5                       | 1,000 – 1,500           |

The Annual Performance Factor (JAZ) is modelled under varying conditions, including building characteristics and fluctuations in ambient air temperature, with a spatial resolution of 100m x 100m. Given that the heat demand data does not differentiate between distinct building types, a global estimate of 1,500 hours per year is applied uniformly across all buildings, as specified in Table 1

## Results

The following evaluations of the potential for air heat are based on the Transition Heat Demand Scenario, as outlined in the Austrian Heat Map. As previously noted, this scenario applies to technologies predominantly utilized in decentralized settings. It presents an ambitious pathway toward decarbonizing the heating sector, particularly through a substantial reduction in space heating demand, achieved via extensive thermal renovation measures and the modernization of the building stock.

The concomitant reduction in heat demand densities directly influences the expansion of potential district heating areas. Consequently, the focus of future heat supply increasingly shifts toward decentralized applications, where air-to-water heat pumps are expected to play a central role—especially in the single-family home sector and among existing buildings with reduced supply temperatures.

The results thus offer a realistic representation of the technically and practically viable air heat potentials, considering stricter efficiency standards and the broader context of an ambitious national heating transition. In this context, heat potential is defined as the thermal energy supplied to the heat pump from the surrounding environment.
