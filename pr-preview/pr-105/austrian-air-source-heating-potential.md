# Austrian Air Source Heating Potential  

## Background 
The objective of the study is to conduct a nationwide, methodologically consistent assessment of renewable energy potentials in Austria for the years 2030 and 2040, employing the appropriate spatial resolution. Key parameters, including the economic viability from both present and future perspectives, site-specific factors, seasonal availability, the influence of technological advancements, and the impacts of climate change on resource availability and exploitation, are systematically considered.

As a result of the study, optimized technical air heat energy potentials are modelled from a cost perspective, incorporating feasibility considerations. The realizable potentials for 2030 and 2040 are presented through the online ESA Web-GIS tool. These potentials are provided with defined ranges, spanning from Low (conservative and less ambitious) to High (optimistic and ambitious), as well as a Medium view (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence).
Currently, no nationwide harmonized dataset exists concerning the spatial distribution of potential for air heat. However, as part of the project "Spatial Energy Planning for Heat Transition" (FFG project 868850), a methodological foundation was established, though it was not fully developed into an operational model. Building upon these initial efforts, the current project has successfully developed, implemented, and applied a consistent methodological framework that is applicable across Austria for determining potential.

According to the market survey 17/2024, by the end of 2023, a total of 491,361 heat pump systems were in operation in Austria, with 68.2% of these being air-to-water heat pumps. The thermal energy provided by all heat pumps amounted to approximately 9,859 GWh, with 6,610 GWh coming from utilized ambient heat. The proportion of air heat within the total utilized ambient heat is simplified by applying the market share for air heat pumps, with similar approaches used for all other types of heat pump systems.
