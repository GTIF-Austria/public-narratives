# Shallow Geothermal Energy and Groundwater
## Introduction
The use of shallow geothermal systems is traditionally well established in Austria, particularly in the form of borehole heat exchangers and groundwater-based systems, which have been successfully applied in many regions for over 30 years. These technologies have become indispensable in practice and are recognized as efficient solutions for providing both heating and cooling. The share of shallow geothermal energy in Austria’s renewable heating market is estimated at more than 20%, with further potential in urban areas, especially regarding seasonal thermal storage and cooling applications in anergy networks [1].

According to the 17/2024 market survey [2], a total of 491,361 heat pump systems were in operation in Austria at the end of 2023, of which 31.7% used groundwater or the subsurface as a heat source. The current stock (2024) of ground-coupled heat pump systems is estimated at approximately 104,300 to 107,700 installations, corresponding to an average annual growth rate of +3.1% since 2022. Groundwater heat pumps in particular continue to grow steadily, with 719 new installations recorded in 2024.

Looking forward, the development of low-temperature supply networks of the fifth generation (5G networks) is expected to play a major role, enabling the use of shallow geothermal energy for heating, cooling, and seasonal storage applications [3].

# Methodological Concept
## Definition and Scope
Shallow geothermal energy (< 300 m below ground surface) encompasses a wide variety of technologies used to access near-surface thermal resources. In addition to the well-known systems—closed vertical collectors (borehole heat exchangers) and open systems based on groundwater extraction—a range of alternative technologies can harness low-temperature heat from the subsurface (“ambient heat”), particularly where drilling is not feasible or groundwater availability is limited. Examples include spiral collectors, ring trench collectors, and massive absorbers. For this reason, heat from the shallow subsurface has been classified as a universally available resource. 

Thermal groundwater use was designated as available only in areas with sufficient aquifer yield. Closed geothermal systems (e.g., borehole heat exchangers) were assumed to be deployable in all areas.

## Theoretical Potential
The thermal energy stored in the shallow subsurface is, in principle, virtually unlimited, as it is replenished continuously by solar radiation, precipitation, and natural geothermal heat flux. Utilization typically occurs at depths of up to 300 meters and temperatures of approximately 25–30 °C using closed systems (borehole heat exchangers, surface collectors, ring trench collectors) or open systems (groundwater heat extraction) [1].

An exact quantification of the total theoretical potential was not carried out due to its theoretical inexhaustibility and its strong dependence on local geological and hydrogeological conditions.

## Technical Potential

The technical feasibility of shallow geothermal systems is determined primarily by the efficiency of the heat pump, which, for the three system types considered (closed vertical, closed horizontal, open), depends largely on the following factors:

*	Heat source for closed vertical systems: undisturbed ground temperature, assumed to remain constant throughout the year [4]
*	Heat source for closed horizontal systems: monthly average ground temperatures at a depth of 3 m
* Heat source for open systems: measured aquifer temperatures [5]
* Heat sink: required supply temperature of the heating or domestic hot water system
A key metric for evaluating system efficiency is the seasonal performance factor (SPF or COP_annual). The greater the temperature difference between source and sink, the lower the seasonal performance factor. 

For determining the SPF, building heat demand from the Austrian Heat Map is divided into a constant domestic hot water demand and a heating demand weighted by heating degree days, based on the distribution of building age classes and renovation levels (see Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3).
