# Supporting energy planning activities at various geographical layers
##Motivation

At present, energy planning requires sound information on the status quo of related demand and supply assets, future supply options as well as on related energy infrastructure. Energy plans for different geographical entities are currently manually created, e.g. by the Austrian Ministry for Climate Action (BMK) or by authorities at the federal or regional level. Advanced EO data can support the creation of such energy plans in a flexible manner. For example, information on available local renewable energy sources or related energy infrastructure may support such developments, serving as a solid basis for energy planning activities in future. 

##Aim

Aim of this service is to assist energy planning activities by use of advanced EO data. For example, the provision of comprehensive geodata on renewable energy resource potentials or on available power grid infrastructure may serve as a crucial input for enhanced energy planning at various geographical layers.

##Method

Currently ongoing studies and analyses related to regional energy planning will serve here as core basis. Of highlight, the ongoing KLIEN study “Erneuerbare Energiepotenziale in Österreich 2030/2040”, led by AIT, will provide geodata on realisable technical potentials of various renewable energies within Austria in future years (2030, 2040), serving as sound basis for such energy planning activities. Another key source of information relates to the available energy infrastructure. For the electricity sector information on the transmission grid infrastructure (at present and in the near future) will be incorporated and merged with other relevant geodata like information on land use and spatial planning. In accordance with stakeholder needs, approaches for aggregation and/or disaggregation will be tested and subsequently deployed.

##Long-term perspective

Basic services will be provided as open source whereas more advanced analyses tailored to the specific needs of the user may be offered as dedicated business service.
Moreover, the establishment of a dedicated Performance Agreement between AIT as service provide and the responsible national/regional authorities would enable a regular update of the underlying data and sources.
