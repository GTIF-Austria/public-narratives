# Building energy efficiency and renovation potential mapped from satellite information for supporting sustainable development strategies of the real estate industry, investors, and political stakeholders

## Problem and Needs

As a matter of fact, building stocks in European countries are ageing and require refurbishing measures specifically to improve energy efficiency. For example, more than 80% of Austrian buildings are currently over 40 years old and need renovation. Utilizing renovation and efficiency improvement potentials supports renewable energy use, minimizes energy losses, and lowers energy consumption, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and improving the ecological footprint. Here remotely sensed satellite data can serve as crucial input for activities related to raising energy efficiency of buildings.

## Solution Capability

Aim of this service is to support users in the identification of renovation potentials and energy efficiency opportunities in a building stock through the use of Earth observation (EO) derived data and the provision of advanced services interfaces including interactive Web cartography.

This service  relies on time series of land surface temperature data from Copernicus Sentinel satellites, provided via the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE). The implemented methodology is based on satellite data and temperature changes, combined with digital data of the building stock, building class, and cadastral data. Available data are analysed to infer building quality, energy consumption, and renovation potentials, geographically constrained to the user-specified Area of Interest (AoI). 

### Map of building energy efficiency and renovation potential

The Capability provides a thematic map product generated for the customer-selected AoI that may span a municipality, a region or an entire country.

### APIs
The map is delivered via two different Application Programming Interfaces (APIs): (1) the OGC Web Map Service (WMS), a Web-standard portrayal and streaming interface for cascaded integration into widely used Geographical Information Systems such as QGIS, and (2) a RESTful machine-to-machine (M2M) API for integration with special end-user IT environments. Both APIs will be access-controlled for an authorized group of users.

### Download,
Maps can also be offered for download as files from an access controlled sFTP Server as GeoPackage (GPKG), an open, non-proprietary, platform-independent standard, building on existing standards, for storing geospatial data (vector and raster data) in a file.

##Long-term perspective
At present, the geographical coverage of the City of Vienna is the pilot area for which the service features are being demonstrated. For this pilot AOI the data provided by the service is open source. Results and lessons learned are being detailed and documented for this pilot. Information is being provided on necessary input and the to be expected output data for any geographical area requested in the future.

The extension to other Austrian regions, to the whole of Austria, or AOIs beyond Austria will be subject to available funding. Depending on customer policies, basic services may be provided as open source whereas more advanced analyses tailored to the specific needs of a specific user may be offered as dedicated business service for the construction sector, administration, building owner, etc.

Moreover, the establishment of a dedicated Performance Agreement between AIT as service provider and the responsible national/regional authorities would enable a regular update of the underlying data and sources.
