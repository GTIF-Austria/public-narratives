# Sustainable development strategies for the real estate industry, investors, and political stakeholders, considering the current building efficiency and future development potentials

##Motivation

At present, more than 80% of Austrian buildings are over 40 years old and need renovation. Utilizing renovation and efficiency improvement potentials supports renewable energy use, reduces energy losses, and lowers energy consumption, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and the ecological footprint. Here EO data can act as crucial input for activities related to renovation potentials and energy efficiency in buildings.

##Aim

Aim of this service is to identify renovation potentials and energy efficiency opportunities in the building stock by use of advanced EO data and services.

##Method

This service related to identify renovation potentials and energy efficiency in buildings relies on time series data of land surface temperature data from Copernicus satellites, provided by CDSE. A methodology based on satellite data and temperature changes, combined with digital data on the building stock, building class, and cadastral data, will be developed. Available data will be analysed to infer building quality, energy consumption, and renovation potentials, geographically constrained to the city of Vienna. Results and lessons learned will be summarized, including information on necessary input and output data for a geographical extension in future.

##Long-term perspective

Geographically a pilot will be tested for the city of Vienna, serving as demonstrator for a potential extension to other regions or the whole of Austria. Basic services will be provided as open source whereas more advanced analyses tailored to the specific needs of the user may be offered as dedicated business service for the construction sector, administration, building owner, etc.
Moreover, the establishment of a dedicated Performance Agreement between AIT as service provide and the responsible national/regional authorities would enable a regular update of the underlying data and sources.

##About

AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH acts as provider for this service.
EOX complements with its IT expertise, acting as host and front-end expert.
