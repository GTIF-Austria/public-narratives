# Site Identification for Renewable Energies
## Motivation
The designation of acceleration areas for renewables, as required by the European renewable energy directive, is a challenging political process involving several stakeholders, including federal and state authorities. One main challenge in the expansion of renewable energies, namely large-scale PV-plants and wind energy, lies in the identification of suitable areas, taking into account the many technical, social and economic restrictions as well as nature and landscape protection. This Regionally structured data on renewable resources and potential areas are therefore an important information for the designation of wind energy development zones and a valuable planning basis for project developers. 
The outcome of this GTIF-AT C activity shall be a suitable data basis and a flexible tool for the localization of large-scale PV-plants and wind turbines. Thereby multi-dimensional visual analytics functionality will be provided by GTIF-AT to those stakeholders, who will ultimately have to decide on RED-III priority area identifications.
## Aim
The aim of this activity is the implementation of an UI for the location of a number of new wind turbines or large-scale PV-plants in a user-specified area. All criteria and parameters in the identification of potential renewable energy areas - spatial planning, designated protected areas, plant technology and economic parameters - can be flexibly parameterized, which means that potential renewable energy areas can be calculated under a wide variety of assumptions and conditions.
## Method
As a basis for the consideration and the identification of potential renewable energy areas, a number of datasets will be prepared. This shall include:
* renewable energy potential (solar irradiation, wind conditions)
* offset distances from settlements and infrastructure
* terrain slope (wind) and orientation (PV)
* designated protected areas.
* an up-to-date database of existing power plants (in particular wind)
Using this input data, a dedicated algorithm will be implemented for the identification of the optimum locations for the renewable energy plants under the given parameters and constraints.
## Long-term perspective
After completion of the ESA contact in early 2026, a handover of the results and services into governance by Austrian stakeholders and into sustainable operation is scheduled to take place. The objectives of this work package are aligned to the requirements of the Austrian stakeholders and the suitable POCs have been nominated to ensure an ongoing input as to the relevant needs and priorities. Austrian stakeholders should thus have a strong interest in the continued availability and maintenance of the results, which will very much help in funding a continued operation.
An economic operation (business perspective) of the tools and services, e.g. helping wind energy project developers in identifying project areas, is also conceivable.
