# Austrian Wind Atlas

## Motivation

Wind energy is an essential and indispensable part of the expansion of renewable energies in Austria, in particular as it complements energy production from photovoltaics and hydropower during the night and in the winter months.

Since many of the areas ostensibly suitable for wind energy are already being used intensively (e.g. in northern Burgenland or in the Weinviertel), the challenge in the further expansion of wind energy increasingly lies in  identifying further suitable areas. The most important criterion for the identification of such areas are suitable wind conditions at the hub height of wind turbines, at about 100 to 200 m above ground.


## Aim

The last comprehensive assessment of wind potential in Austria was carried out in the AuWiPot study in 2011.
The aim of this activity is to provide an update to this dataset.
- greater hub heights

- high resolution data for wind power density in different heights above ground
- provision of wind power density as an on-demand service

## Method

The main tool for the creation of the Austrian wind atlas will be a geo-statistical model for the sub-grid scaling of numerical weather models using high resolution geographical data and terrain roughness. This tool will be developed using the existing geo-statistical model from the previous AuWiPot study as a starting point. That way, it will be ensured that the tried and proved qualities of the existing AuWiPot wind atlas, which is still unsurpassed 13 years after its creation, will be retained in this new project. At the same time, updated and improved input data (e.g. meteorological model, terrain data, roughnesses, etc.) and an adaption to the current state of technology, such as turbine dimensions and performance, will improve its accuracy, its spatial and temporal resolution and thus guarantee its usefulness for many years to come. This in particular includes coverage of the relevant hub heights of the current and the future generation of wind turbines and the provision of wind power density information in addition to wind speed.
This process involves the following steps:
•	Preparation of input data sets, in particular WRF model datasets
•	Calibration, testing, and validation of the geo-statistical model
•	Application of the geo-statistical coefficients and wind shear profiles to obtain Austria-wide dataset for the wind conditions in different heights above ground (wind atlas). 
The implementation of this will primarily take place with usual programming and modelling tools such as R, Python, and QGIS.

The method employed in the calculation of the data for the Austrian wind atlas can be applied to other countries or regions.
It is thus planed to provide this algorithm via ESA's network of resources and transferability of the algorithm will be considered in the implementation of the method.

Energiewerkstatt will employ its extensive expertise on the Austrian wind conditions and wind energy potential assembled in decades of wind measurement activities in all Austrian regions and the numerous studies on the wind energy potential.

## Continuance

After completion of the ESA contact in early 2026, a handover of the results and services into governance by Austrian stakeholders and into sustainable operation is scheduled to take place.
The objectives of this work package are aligned to the requirements of the Austrian stakeholders and the suitable POCs have been nominated to ensure an ongoing input as to the relevant needs and priorities.
Austrian stakeholders should thus have a strong interest in the continued availability and maintenance of the results, which will very much help in funding a continued operation.
