Rising temperatures and increasing heat stress pose significant challenges for city population, particularly during summer and require urban planners to transform cities into resilient and climate-adapted living spaces. Cities, with built-up areas and extensive sealed surfaces, create heat hotspots, exacerbating thermal discomfort and health risks. Vulnerable groups - such as the elderly, children, and individuals with chronic health conditions - are especially affected, facing an increased risk of heat-related illnesses and mortality. At the same time, fluctuating temperatures drive dynamic energy demands. The growing need for cooling in summer and heating in winter places additional pressure on energy infrastructure, requiring more efficient supply management and forecasting.

Traditional weather models, based on regional-scale meteorological data, lack the spatial resolution necessary to capture the fine-scale temperature variations caused by urban morphology. The need for such a fine grid spacing is illustrated in Figure 1. Urban heat islands significantly influence local climate conditions, creating temperature differences that coarse-resolution models (typically 1–10 km grids) cannot capture. Accurate, high-resolution urban weather forecasts are essential for mitigating health risks, optimizing energy distribution, and enhancing overall urban resilience.

## the challenge
### forecast air temperature on a spatial scale that is representing urban features
A numerical model is computing values on a 3-dimensional grid. For each of the model grid boxes, one e.g. air temperature value is calculated for time steps in the future.  State-of-the-art local weather forecast models are computed typically with a mesh size in the order of 2km.  

## our solution
### tailor-made high-resolution temperature forecasts for your city

GeoSphere Austria provides the latest technology to forecast urban weather phenomena more detailed than typically available, with a fine spatial scale of 100 meters. Unlike standard weather models, this approach incorporates urban-specific data to deliver detailed forecasts at the district level.

This advanced modelling approach can support a wide range of stakeholders, including:

•	**Public authorities** and **crisis managers** to enhance disaster preparedness and response.  
•	**Urban planners** and **policymakers** to design heat-resilient and energy-efficient cities.  
•	**Energy providers** to optimize heating and cooling operations with more precise demand forecasting.

By improving weather information at an urban scale, we empower cities to better adapt to weather and climate extremes.

### workflow

By integrating precise satellite-based data, air temperature and derived variables can be calculated on a 100-meter grid to simulate and forecast their spatial and hourly variations providing a database for informed decision-making. The model integrates multiple high-resolution datasets to enhance forecast accuracy:
›	**Satellite-based land cover data** (e.g., Sentinel-2) to map surface properties and urban structures.
›	**Building density and surface material analysis** to account for urban heat storage and emission.
›	**Vegetation and green space influence** to assess cooling effects from parks and tree canopies.
›	**Anthropogenic heat emissions** from industry and residential heating/cooling.
