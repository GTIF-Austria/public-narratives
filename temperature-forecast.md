# The challenge of forecasting urban extreme temperature 

![Skizze](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6da9d271-a1cb-4622-b675-280587197fd6)

Rising temperatures and increasing heat stress pose challenges for city residents in summer and require urban planners to transform cities into resilient and climate-adapted living spaces. So-called heat hotspots arise particularly in densely built-up and heavily sealed areas. This problem particularly affects vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children and people with chronic illnesses. In winter, on the other hand, severe frost can lead to cold deaths and other dangers, especially in traffic (black ice). 

Weather-related health risks are increasing, as does the need especially for cooling but also for heating of buildings, thus challenging the energy suppliers. The importance of precise weather forecasts, especially in urban areas, is therefore growing rapidly.

## Our solution: tailor-made high-resolution temperature forecasts for your city

GeoSphere Austria is working with the latest technology to forecast urban weather phenomena more accurately than typically available. By integrating precise satellite-based (e.g. Sentinel 2) land cover data and additional information, the air temperature and derived variables can be calculated on a 100-meter grid. The need for such a fine grid spacing is represented in Fig. 2. To be able to do planning on the district level, the poutput of current global and local weather models (10-1km) is not sufficient. 
This advanced model approach helps not only the public, but also actors in the State Crisis and Disaster Management (SKKM) to respond to potential dangers more quickly and efficiently. In addition, the forecasts can be used to predict heating or cooling requirements. The more detailed the temperature forecast, the more accurately the energy requirement can be estimated to increase the efficiency of energy supplier systems.
