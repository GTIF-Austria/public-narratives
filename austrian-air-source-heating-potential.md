# Austrian Air Source Heating Potential  

## Background 
For the sub-technology field of ambient air heat, no nationwide harmonized dataset on the spatial distribution of potential has been available to date. Within the project Spatial Energy Planning for Heat Transition (FFG Project 868850), an initial methodological foundation was established; however, this was not transferred into an operational model. Building on this preliminary work, the present project developed, implemented, and applied a consistent methodological framework suitable for determining the potential across Austria.

According to the Market Survey 17/2024 [60], a total of 491,361 heat pump systems were in operation in Austria at the end of 2023, of which 68.2% were air-source heat pumps [58].

The thermal energy supplied by all heat pump systems amounted to approximately 9,859 GWh, of which 6,610 GWh can be attributed to utilized environmental heat [60], [58], [63]. The share of ambient air within total environmental heat utilization is approximated based on the respective market shares of air-source heat pumps (and analogously for all other heat pump source systems).
 

## Methodological Concept

### Definition and Delimitation
In this study, the potential for air heat is

defined as the utilization of ambient air as an energy source for air-to-water heat pumps, primarily to meet space heating and hot water demands in buildings, as well as for integration into district heating networks. This technology field encompasses not only air-to-water heat pumps but also includes hot water heat pumps, air-to-air heat pumps, and ventilation systems with heat recovery in decentralized applications.

### Theoretical Potential:
The thermal energy stored in ambient air is, under standard conditions, physically unlimited. Due to its theoretical nature of being inexhaustible and its limited relevance for estimating potential, no explicit quantification was conducted in this study.

### Technical Potential:
The technical viability of utilizing air heat is predominantly influenced by the efficiency of the heat pump, which is primarily governed by the following factors:

* Heat Source: The average monthly ambient air temperature at the specific location.
* Heat Sink: The required supply temperature for the heating or hot water system, which is determined by the building's construction period and its renovation status.

To determine the Annual Performance Factor (JAZ), the heat demand, as outlined by the Austrian Heat Map, is partitioned into a constant hot water demand (WWB) and a heating degree-day weighted space heating demand (HWB). This division is based on the distribution of building ages and their respective renovation statuses (see Figure 1).

### Explanation of Performance Calculation:
In the context of air heat pumps employed for combined space heating and hot water production in Austrian single-family homes (EFH), the following practical guidelines are typically applied:

##### Table 1: Full load hours of an air heat pump for combined space heating and hot water production in a typical Austrian single-family home (EFH)

| Building Type / Standard       | Space Heating + Hot Water [kWh/a] | Heat Pump Rated Power [kW] | Full Load Hours [h/a] |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Old Building (unsanated)       | 20,000 – 25,000                    | 10 – 14                     | 1,800 – 2,200           |
| New Building (well insulated)  | 8,000 – 12,000                     | 6 – 8                       | 1,300 – 1,600           |
| Low energy / Passive House     | 4,000 – 6,000                      | 3 – 5                       | 1,000 – 1,500           |

The Annual Performance Factor (JAZ) is modelled under varying conditions, including building characteristics and fluctuations in ambient air temperature, with a spatial resolution of 100m x 100m. Given that the heat demand data does not differentiate between distinct building types, a global estimate of 1,500 hours per year is applied uniformly across all buildings, as specified in Table 1

## Results

The following evaluations of the potential for air heat are based on the Transition Heat Demand Scenario, as outlined in the Austrian Heat Map. As previously noted, this scenario applies to technologies predominantly utilized in decentralized settings. It presents an ambitious pathway toward decarbonizing the heating sector, particularly through a substantial reduction in space heating demand, achieved via extensive thermal renovation measures and the modernization of the building stock.

The concomitant reduction in heat demand densities directly influences the expansion of potential district heating areas. Consequently, the focus of future heat supply increasingly shifts toward decentralized applications, where air-to-water heat pumps are expected to play a central role—especially in the single-family home sector and among existing buildings with reduced supply temperatures.

The results thus offer a realistic representation of the technically and practically viable air heat potentials, considering stricter efficiency standards and the broader context of an ambitious national heating transition. In this context, heat potential is defined as the thermal energy supplied to the heat pump from the surrounding environment.

**Impact of Climate Change and Comparison**

The increasing air temperatures resulting from climate change influence the efficiency of air heat pumps in two primary ways. First, the higher average outdoor air temperature improves the Carnot efficiency, leading to an increase in the Annual Performance Factor (JAZ). Second, the warming of the atmosphere reduces the demand for space heating, a factor that has already been accounted for in the underlying demand data.

To quantify the temperature-related effects, air temperatures from the Secures-MET dataset under the climate change scenario RCP4.5 (moderate) for the years 2030 and 2050 were utilized. Overall, the temperature growth results in a rise in the potential for air heat, as illustrated in Figure 10. Specifically, the technical potential increases by approximately 3.4 TWh, or around 10%. Given that the heat demand—and consequently the amount of heat produced by the heat pump—is exogenously incorporated into the modelling and remains consistent across both scenarios, the electricity demand of the heat pumps decreases in the moderate climate change scenario.

## Evaluation of Results

Air heat currently represents the most widely deployed ambient heat technology in Austria. Its high availability, relatively low development costs, and potential for rapid scalability position it as a critical technology for the energy transition in heating.

The potential analysis indicates that the utilization of air heat could realistically expand from 4.5 TWh in 2023 to approximately 20.4 TWh (ambient heat supplied to the heat pump) by 2040. Achieving this growth will require ambitious renovation rates, the decarbonization of individual heating systems, and the implementation of economic incentives to promote high-efficiency heat pumps. These factors are pivotal in driving the scaling of air heat technologies.
