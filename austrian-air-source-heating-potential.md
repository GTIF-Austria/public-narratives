# Austrian Air Source Heating Potential  

## Background 
For the sub-technology field of ambient air heat, no nationwide harmonized dataset on the spatial distribution of potential has been available to date. Within the project Spatial Energy Planning for Heat Transition (FFG Project 868850), an initial methodological foundation was established; however, this was not transferred into an operational model. Building on this preliminary work, the present project developed, implemented, and applied a consistent methodological framework suitable for determining the potential across Austria.

According to the Market Survey 17/2024 [60], a total of 491,361 heat pump systems were in operation in Austria at the end of 2023, of which 68.2% were air-source heat pumps [58].

The thermal energy supplied by all heat pump systems amounted to approximately 9,859 GWh, of which 6,610 GWh can be attributed to utilized environmental heat [60], [58], [63]. The share of ambient air within total environmental heat utilization is approximated based on the respective market shares of air-source heat pumps (and analogously for all other heat pump source systems).
 

## Methodological Concept

### Definition and Delimitation
In this study, ambient air heat potential refers to the use of outdoor air as an energy source for air-to-water heat pumps, particularly for meeting space heating and domestic hot water demand in buildings, as well as for feeding heat into district heating networks. Domestic hot water heat pumps, air-to-air heat pumps, and residential ventilation systems with heat recovery are also considered part of this technology field in decentralized applications.

### Theoretical Potential
The thermal energy stored in ambient air is—under normal conditions—physically available without limitation. Due to this theoretical boundlessness and its limited relevance for potential assessment, no explicit quantification of the theoretical potential was conducted.

### Technical Potential
The technical usability of ambient air heat is determined primarily by the efficiency of the heat pump, which is influenced by the following key parameters:

* Heat source: average monthly outdoor air temperature at the respective location
* Heat sink: required supply temperature in the heating and domestic hot water system, depending on the building’s construction period and renovation status

For determining the seasonal performance factor (SPF/JAZ), the heating demand according to the Austrian Heat Map is divided—based on the distribution of building age classes and renovation levels—into a constant domestic hot water demand (DHW) and a heating degree-day–weighted space heating demand (SHD) (see Figure 1).

### Explanation of Performance Calculation:
For air-source heat pumps used for combined space heating and domestic hot water production in Austrian single-family homes (SFH), the following practical benchmark values apply:

##### Table 1: Full load hours of an air heat pump for combined space heating and hot water production in a typical Austrian single-family home (EFH)

| Building Type / Standard            | Space Heating + Hot Water [kWh/a] | Heat Pump Rated Power [kW] | Full Load Hours [h/a] |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Old Building (unsanated)            | 20,000 – 25,000                  | 10 – 14                    | 1,800 – 2,200         |
| New Building (well insulated)      | 8,000 – 12,000                   | 6 – 8                      | 1,300 – 1,600         |
| Low energy / Passive House          | 4,000 – 6,000                    | 3 – 5                      | 1,000 – 1,500         |

The seasonal performance factors are modelled at a spatial resolution of 100 m × 100 m under varying boundary conditions (building characteristics, evolution of outdoor air temperatures). Since the heat demand data do not allow differentiation by building type (e.g., single-family homes, office buildings), a uniform value of 1,500 full-load hours per year is assumed for all buildings, in accordance with Table 66. Potential changes in full-load hours resulting from technological or regulatory developments, as well as from the integration of thermal storage systems, are not considered in this analysis.

## Results

The following analyses of ambient air heat potential are based on the Transition heat demand scenario of the Austrian Heat Map. As noted earlier, this scenario is used for technologies that are predominantly deployed in decentralized applications. It represents an ambitious decarbonization pathway for the heating sector and, in particular, assumes a substantial reduction in space heating demand due to comprehensive thermal refurbishment measures and modernization of the building stock.

The associated decline in heat demand density has a direct impact on the spatial extent of prospective district heating areas. Consequently, the focus of future heat supply increasingly shifts toward decentralized solutions, in which air-to-water heat pumps can assume a central role—especially in single-family homes and in the existing building stock with reduced supply temperature requirements.

The results thus provide a realistic depiction of the technically and practically achievable ambient air heat potentials under tightened efficiency requirements and within the context of an ambitious national heat-transition strategy. In this context, heat potential refers to the amount of thermal energy that is extracted from the ambient air and supplied to the heat pump.

### Impact of Climate Change and Comparison

Rising air temperatures as a result of climate change affect the efficiency of air-source heat pumps in two ways. First, higher average outdoor air temperatures improve the Carnot efficiency, thereby increasing the seasonal performance factor (SPF/JAZ). Second, atmospheric warming reduces the demand for space heating, a development that is already reflected in the underlying heat demand data.

To estimate these temperature-related effects, the air temperature data from the Secures-MET dataset [67] were applied for the climate change scenario RCP4.5 (moderate) for the years 2030 and 2050. Overall, the increase in temperature results in a rise in the potential for ambient air heat, as illustrated in Figure 10. In particular, the technical potential increases by approximately 3.4 TWh, or about 10%. Since heat demand (and thus the amount of heat produced by the heat pump) is incorporated exogenously into the modelling and remains constant across the two scenarios, the electricity demand of heat pumps decreases in the moderate climate change scenario.

### Evaluation of Results

Ambient air heat is currently the most widespread ambient heat technology in Austria. Its high availability, comparatively low development costs, and rapid scalability make it a key technology for the heat transition. 

The potential analysis shows that the use of ambient air heat could increase from the current level of approximately 4.5 TWh (2023) to around 20.4 TWh of supplied environmental heat by 2040 under realistic market trajectories. Key drivers of this expansion include ambitious renovation rates (in line with WEM 2023), the decarbonization of individual heating systems, and economic incentives for high-efficiency heat pumps. However, several additional factors must also be taken into account:

* Electricity prices and the availability of renewable power: The economic viability and climate impact of air-source heat pumps depend strongly on the development of electricity prices and the share of renewables in the electricity mix. A high share of renewable electricity generation is essential to minimize indirect emissions.
* Grid infrastructure and load management: The additional electricity demand resulting from large-scale heat pump deployment puts new requirements on power grids. Load management strategies, flexibility options, and, where necessary, storage solutions are needed to prevent grid congestion.
* Competition for electricity: Electricity demand is increasing not only due to the heat transition but also in other sectors, such as the rapid uptake of electromobility. This may lead to supply constraints and rising electricity prices, potentially affecting the economic performance of air-source heat pumps.
* Noise emissions in urban areas: Noise emissions represent a critical factor for public acceptance, particularly in densely populated areas where large potentials have been identified. Technical solutions—including low-noise fans and noise-mitigating structural measures—must therefore be considered.

Ambient air heat remains a central technology for the decarbonization of the heating sector. Its continued expansion, however, requires a holistic assessment of electricity supply, grid capacities, and regulatory frameworks, as well as the consideration of acceptance-related factors such as noise emissions
