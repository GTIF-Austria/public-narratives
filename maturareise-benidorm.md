#### "Up Early"
Our journey starts infront of my house at 2:30 in the morning. Two of my friends joined my mum and I on the trip to the airport. We needed someone to take the car back home, so my mum drove us.

#### At the airport
Shortly after arriving, we met up with everyone else, managed to get onto the plane hassle-free and before we knew it, we were already on our way to spain.

#### Arriving in Espa√±a
As soon as we had made it to Alicante Airport, we immediately started looking for the next bus to take us into the city center.

#### In Alicante
Since our AirBnB was located in Benidorm and we were only able to check in after 4pm, we decided to spend the day at the beach with all of our luggage. Luckily none of it got stolen. As the sun started to set, we organized some taxis to get us to our house in Benidorm.

#### Exploring the rental
Of course the first thing we did after arriving at our place, was to split up the bedrooms. I got pretty lucky, only having to share a room with one other person. We spent the remaining days of our vacation migrating between Benidorm and our amazing pool. On the morning of the final day, our host drove us to the airport.
