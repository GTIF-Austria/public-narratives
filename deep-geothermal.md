# Deep Geothermal

<p style="text-align: justify;"> ## Background

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Deep geothermal energy comprises applications at depths of 300 meters and greater, where temperatures ranging from above 30 °C to well over 100 °C can be exploited. Deep geothermal energy has a long history in Austria and offers substantial potential, particularly for the provision of heat that is independent of diurnal and seasonal fluctuations. Through the utilization of natural thermal water resources and innovative technologies such as petrothermal (enhanced geothermal) systems, deep geothermal energy has gained increasing attention in recent years.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The potential of deep geothermal energy in Austria is considerable. Particularly promising is the integration of geothermal systems into industrial applications and district heating networks, where deep geothermal energy can provide a reliable and sustainable heat source [1].

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In Austria, deep geothermal energy is almost exclusively developed as hydro-geothermal energy, i.e. through the use of natural thermal water reservoirs. Hydro-geothermal applications have been in use for nearly 50 years. The development of deep geothermal energy in Austria benefits from a long tradition and a solid foundation of geoscientific exploration data, particularly derived from more than 80 years of hydrocarbon exploration activities.

## Methodology

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The technically exploitable potential of deep geothermal energy in Austria is primarily associated with specific geological regions. Among the most significant are the Vienna Basin, the Molasse Basin in Upper Austria and Salzburg, the Styrian Basin, the Molasse Basin and Helvetic units in Vorarlberg, as well as the eastern margin of the Molasse Zone in Lower Austria.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> However, Austria currently lacks a comprehensive nationwide characterization of the deep subsurface (> 300 m below ground level) that would be required for a robust assessment of deep geothermal utilization. Prior to the 3D seismic campaign conducted by Wien Energie and OMV for the development of deep geothermal energy for Vienna’s district heating network, available data largely consisted of borehole and seismic datasets originating from the hydrocarbon industry. These data are restricted to favourable areas of hydrocarbon exploration, resulting in considerable regional variability in data density across federal states, and are generally not publicly accessible. As a consequence, the potential of deep geothermal energy in many parts of Austria can currently only be estimated. 

## Results

#### Assessment of Technical Potentials

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Within the framework of the project, an updated mapping of hydrothermal reservoirs in Austria was carried out. The newly developed map (Figure 1) illustrates geological formations with confirmed occurrences of thermal water, applying the criterion that at least one verified borehole must be present. These hydrothermal reservoirs are defined by a temperature threshold exceeding 40 °C and have so far constituted the primary focus of deep geothermal utilization in Austria.

###### Figure 1: Overview of hydrothermal reservoirs > 40 °C (blue areas), potential occurrences of thermal waters (light blue), and areas where isolated occurrences of thermal water are possible (green) in Austria.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> The blue areas in the figure indicate regions with proven hydrothermal resources. In addition, so-called “prospective areas” were identified; these are regions that exhibit geoscientific potential for further investigation, irrespective of existing or planned infrastructure for heat offtake. For all identified hydrothermal reservoirs, Geosphere Austria has also prepared detailed descriptions of the individual reservoirs.
	
<p style="text-align: justify;"> In addition to existing borehole data, the map incorporates newly reassessed areas. The light green areas denote regions with potential occurrences of thermal waters and thus represent possible expansion zones for future geothermal utilization. Areas shown in dark green predominantly comprise alpine regions where isolated occurrences of thermal waters may be present. However, this does not imply that no deep geothermal potential exists in these areas; rather, it reflects a lack of geological data, which has so far prevented a comprehensive spatial assessment.

#### Assessment of Realizable Potentials

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In the R&I Roadmap for Geothermal Energy [2], the following overview of geothermal potentials and proposed expansion targets was published.

###### Figure 2 Current scope of application, identified resources, and geothermal expansion targets for 2030 and 2050 as proposed by the Austrian Geothermal Association (GTÖ).

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Numerous earlier studies (including GeoEnergie2050, GeoTiefEXPLORE, Transenergy) estimate the total hydrogeothermal potential in Austria at approximately 400–1,200 MWth. More recent investigations in the central Vienna Basin indicate a sustainable technical potential exceeding 1,000 MWth_\text{th}th at a reinjection temperature of 70 °C.
	
<p style="text-align: justify;"> At present, the installed capacity amounts to approximately 104 MWth, distributed across ten heating plants, with an annual heat production of around 350 GWhth. By 2030, an expansion of capacities by an additional 100 MWth is anticipated, corresponding to an annual production of up to 1.5 TWh of geothermal heat. In the longer term, by 2040, a near tripling of installed capacity is expected, particularly in the context of district heating supply for large urban agglomerations such as Vienna and Graz [3]. Overall, the actual feasibility of deep geothermal utilization is closely linked to the proximity of geological resources to areas with high heat demand density [4]. With regard to levelized cost of heat (LCOH), based on existing geothermal installations and relevant studies [5], a range of 20–60 €/MWh can be assumed for deep geothermal energy.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In the Vienna Basin, the first deep geothermal drilling operations are currently underway in the greater Vienna area to feed thermal water from depths of approximately 3,000 meters into Vienna’s district heating network—one of the largest in Europe. These initial deep geothermal wells are expected to supply heat to around 20,000 households in Vienna. The long-term objective is to expand capacity to 200 MWth of thermal output and to supply approximately 200,000 households with geothermal heat [6].

<p style="text-align: justify;"> In 2024, the third geothermal power plant for electricity generation in Austria commenced operation in Fürstenfeld (Styria) [3]. In addition, preparations are currently underway in the southern Vienna Basin/Industrial Quarter as well as in the Molasse zones of Upper Austria and Salzburg (Alpine foreland) for the expansion of existing geothermal facilities (e.g. Simbach–Braunau, Geinberg) and for the construction of new plants.

### Assessment and Outlook

<p style="text-align: justify;"> While the current utilization of deep geothermal energy in Austria is almost exclusively focused on hydrothermal systems, this should by no means be interpreted as a limitation of the available options. Outside the identified hydrothermal zones, additional geothermal potentials may exist that have not yet been identified or investigated. In such areas, alternative geothermal systems may be applied, including deep borehole heat exchangers, closed-loop systems, or the exploitation of petrothermal rock formations through hydraulic stimulation. These technologies also enable flexible and location-independent use of deep geothermal energy, even in the absence of naturally occurring thermal water.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Particularly in the high-temperature segment of deep geothermal energy, there is substantial potential for integration into centralized district heating networks and for the supply of industrial process heat up to 120 °C, and up to 200 °C when combined with high-temperature heat pumps. Such systems enable centralized, climate-neutral heat supply for entire districts or cities.
