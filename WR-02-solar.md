# Evolve site identification capabilities for solar energy expansion to support the identification of acceleration areas

## General introduction
Are you looking for the ideal spot to install a photovoltaic system? This GTIF-capability makes it easy to identify the most promising locations for solar energy production. 
Powered by the high-resolution global radiation dataset APOLIS **[TODO: Describe APOLIS]**, GTIF delivers precise and reliable data to help you make informed decisions on where solar installations 
will be most effective. Whether you are planning a new project or expanding an existing one, this capability empowers you with user-defined queries to pinpoint areas with the highest solar 
energy potential **[TODO: Specify highest solar potential, but depends on the type of PV plant]**.

## Product description
Here in GTIF the global solar radiation data will be provided. This data is exceptionally detailed, accounting for local shadowing effects from buildings and vegetation. 
As a user, you have the flexibility to choose the time resolution at which the data is displayed. **[TODO: Specify temporal resolution of the data, suggestion: double check with “bundesweiter Solarkataster and use same aggregates”]** 
Additionally, you can opt to exclude  certain areas from consideration for your system’s location. This product offers the option to use special overlays to ensure that your system is not located in a nature protection area, 
for example. **[TODO: Specify overlays]** 

**[TODO(?): add description for private people which want to check the potential of their rooftop]**

## Availability
High-resolution radiation analyses of diffuse and direct radiation as well as a high-resolution surface model are required to create this product. 
This product is accessible for Austria. A calculation for other countries is not possible. 

## Longterm perspective
TBD
