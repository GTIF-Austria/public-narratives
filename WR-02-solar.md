# Site identification capability for solar energy expansion

Are you looking for the ideal spot to install a photovolataic system? This GTIF-capability makes it easy to identify the most promising locations for solar energy production.

## Problem definition and starting position 

Austria aims to become climate neutral by 2040. To help reach this goal, solar energy needs to grow quickly and in a smart way. Accoring to ÖNIP (Integrated Austrian Grid Infrasturcture Plan) photovolaic systems will need to produce 21 TWh by 2030 and 41 TWh to support Austria’s climate and energy goals.

The status oft he current photovolatik expansion can be tracked in the  [PV Austria Dashboard]( https://pvaustria.at/dashboard/).  Achieving this goal is not just a matter of putting up more photovolaic panels – it requires strategic, well informed decisions about where solar infrastructure should be placed. To adress this, we propse a robust framework to support the site identification for installing photovoltaic plants. 

## What do we offer? 

Here in GTIF the mean global solar radiation data will be provided. This data accounts for terrain shading and real atmospheric conidtions. The information is based on the APOLIS Dataset from GeoSphere Austria, which provides data at a spatial resolution of 100m.  
Additionally, you can opt to exculde certain areas from condideration for your system’s location. These areas could be national parks European protected areas, nature reserves, landscape conservation areas, etc.

## You want more? 

### Inadequate temporal resolution? 
100m data is sufficient for you, but you want more detailed temporal information? No problem, get in touch with us. We are happy to provide more than just mean yearly sums, depending on your needs.   

### Inadequate spatial resolution?
A data basis of 100m is not enough for you? No problem, get in touch with us.  For your special needs, we can provide exceptionally detailed data, additionally accounting for local shadowing effects from buildings and vegetation.
